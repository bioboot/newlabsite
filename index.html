    Our research involves the use of computational approaches, based on both <em>biophysics</em> and <em>bioinformatics</em>, to study the structure, function and evolution of key biological macromolecules. 
  </p>

  <p>
    We are particularly interested in natureâ€™s nanomachines: <strong><a href="{{ "/research/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">molecular motors and switches</a></strong>, which lie at the heart of important biological processes, from the division and growth of cells to the muscular movement of organisms. A major portion of our research is focused on deciphering how these fascinating proteins work, and how to manipulate them for industrial and medical advantage. <a href="{{ "/research/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">Read more &rarr;</a>

    Here is a place for thumbnail like image slider gallery with links to both the research and gallery pages. Could do this with <a href="http://nanogallery.brisbois.fr">nanogallery</a> perhaps?  <br/><br/>

            There are lots of opportunities to get involved in our work! In addition to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">postdoctoral openings</a>, we are interested in hearing from energetic University of Michigan graduate and undergraduate students who would like to learn more about our research. Prospective postdocs and students should contact Professor Grant directly (bjgrant@umich.edu).

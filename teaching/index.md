### BGGN-213: [Foundations of Bioinformatics](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_f17/) 

Bioinformatics is driving the collection and analysis of big data in the biosciences. This new course is designed for bioscience graduate students at UCSD and provides a hands-on introduction to the computer-based analysis of genomic and biomolecular data.

Major topics include: *Genome informatics*, *Structural informatics*, *Transcriptomics*, *UNIX for bioinformatics*, and *Bioinformatics data analysis with R*.  

Students completing this course will be able to evaluate new genomic and biomolecular information using existing software and gain experience in combining bioinformatic approaches to answer specific biological questions.  

A comprehensive [class website](https://bioboot.github.io/bggn213_f17/) containing all reading materials, screencasts and course notes will be maintained throughout the term.

### BIOINF-525: [Foundations of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology](http://bioboot.github.io/bioinf525_w16/) 

I serve as lead instructor and course director for *Foundations of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology* (*BIOINF525*). This course provides an introduction to the principles and practical approaches of bioinformatics as applied to genes and proteins. Offered in the winter term each year BIOINF525 is currently comprised of three one credit modules covering:

1. [Foundations of Bioinformatics](http://bioboot.github.io/bioinf525_w16/module1/); 
2. [Statistics in Bioinformatics](http://bioboot.github.io/bioinf525_w16/module2/); and 
3. [Systems Biology](http://bioboot.github.io/bioinf525_w16/module3/).

### BIOINF-606: [Introduction to Biocomputing](http://bioboot.github.io/web-2016/) 

I serve as a principal instructor and co-course director for *Introduction to Biocomputing* (*BIOINF606*). This hands-on one week course introduces new graduate students to computational tools, techniques and best practices that foster reproducible research in bioinformatics, genome informatics and biostatistics.

### GIDAS: [High School Student Instruction and Outreach](http://www.mircore.org/gidas/)

I currently serve as an instructor and mentor for both the annual [High School Genes In Disease and Symptoms (GIDAS)](http://www.mircore.org/gidas/) club and the [Ann Arbor Computational Biology Camp](http://www.mircore.org/gidas/2016-summer-camp/2016-r-camp/) (for 9th-12th grade students). GIDAS club activities run from August through June with the purpose of having high school students both learn and participate in computational biology research. Through GIDAS, I have presented lectures to groups of 25-40 selected high school students from the Ann Arbor, Detroit and Flint areas. These lectures introduced genomics and bioinformatics concepts and were followed with small group based research projects exploring public gene expression data sets. I mentored students in the use of online bioinformatics tools and databases, as well as how to formulate their hypotheses and present their results in poster and oral formats. In the Ann Arbor Computational Biology Camps for high schoolers, I have taught week long summer sessions to over 50 students in UNIX computing and data analysis with the R programing language. An important component of these camps is their intended amplifying effect, with attendees instructed to disseminate what they learn to their school peers via their schoolâ€™s GIDAS club.

### BIOINF-800: [Computational Biophysics & Structure Based Drug Discovery]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching/material/example_new_course.pdf) 
This graduate-level seminar course will walk students through the major techniques of biomolecular simulation and computer-aided drug design. This will include application of massively parallel molecular dynamics simulations and associated analysis techniques to enable new discoveries within the vast quantity of digital data, such as finding new potential drug leads through virtual screening and small molecule docking. Lectures on course concepts will be closely combined with hands-on tutorials that allow the practical application of computational methods and statistical data analysis in a project-based format. Students will be granted access to the national supercomputers centers as well as local high performance computing cluster resources to run their simulations and analyze the resulting data.

Once established in the lab I encourage everyone to attend at least one meeting a year. Don't pass up the opportunity to give a talk, but go even if you are not presenting a talk. Once you are at a meeting be as active as you can about learning the field and meeting people. Poster sessions are the best places to meet and interact with other scientists. Go to as many posters as you can. Ask questions. Take addresses. Always try to present a poster if you can (even if you are giving a talk).

### Recommended meetings
Below is a list of some recommended meetings. If there are other meetings you would like to attend, and preferably present at, please just ask and we will try to facilitate your attendance.

Many conferences have **travel funds** available through inquiring with organizers as well as through travel grant applications. Getting these funds can be an excellent line on your CV.

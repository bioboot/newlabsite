##### (modified from D. Zuckerman)
 
Your co-authors and research supervisor may not want to see your manuscript draft unless ...

<br /> 

#### General

- Have you followed the structure outlined and discussed [here]({{"news/2016/09/18/structuring-your-scientific-paper/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
- Does each paragraph focus on a single idea or point which is introduced/summarized in the paragraph’s first sentence? Remember that a paragraph is like a mini-essay - see this post on [paragraph structure]({{"news/2016/09/18/structuring-your-scientific-paper/#a-note-on-paragraph-structure" | prepend: site.baseurl }}). 
- Is the flow of logic clear from paragraph to paragraph? From your draft, you should be able to (re)write the outline of the paper – in fact, just from the first sentences of the paragraphs. Check this.
- Did you repeat key points in several sections to emphasize them?
- Did you spend a lot more time on logic and clarity in addition to grammar and sentence structure?
- Have you ruthlessly avoided complicated sentences? Remember that clarity will always trump elegance.  

<br />
 
#### Abstract

- Does the abstract avoid distracting technical details?
- Is it clear from the abstract why the work is new and worthy of publication?

<br />
 
#### Introduction

- Did you clearly explain the reason why the work was done – the existing problem?
- Did you clearly and briefly explain what you did to make progress – what’s new?
- Did you cite pertinent work done before? Even by people you may not like?
- Did you read the introductions of several related papers to be sure you explained the ideas properly and cited the important work?

<br />
 
#### Methods

- Did you remind your readers why a new/old method was used? You can write a mini-introduction for the Methods section.
- Did you provide enough information so a reader could exactly reproduce your results? The whole procedure should be outlined, even if some details must be found in other work or Supplemental Information.

<br />
 
#### Results

- Did you make sure the main results are not buried? Again, use mini-introductions.
- Did you save commentary and speculation for the Discussion section?

<br />
 
#### Discussion

- Did you clearly explain what’s new, as compared to previous work?
- Did you avoid repeating information from the Results section?
- Did you admit the limitations of your work?
- Did you describe future applications, improvements, and generalizations?

<br />
 
#### Conclusions

- Could a reader in a rush read just the Conclusions and learn just about everything (including acronyms)?
- Did you avoid exaggeration and let the data speak for itself?
- Did you acknowledge everyone who helped, including funding agencies?

<br />
 
#### Figures

- Do figure titles describe the main point of each figure?
- Have you put labels/arrows in the graphic to minimize effort for the reader?
 
<br />

#### Wait!

- Did you go back to the ‘General’ section above and double-check those paragraphs and logic – even in the Results section? 
- Did you make several revisions of the entire manuscript (after completing a first draft)?
- Did you check journal-specific formatting – section order; figures; references?
- Did you put the date on your draft so that a reader with two versions can be sure of reviewing the latest one?
- Did you include page numbers so reviewers can easily reference sections when discussing the draft with you?
- If there is a deadline did you tell your co-authors about it?

##### (modified from D. Zuckerman)
 
Your co-authors (and/or research supervisor) may not want to see your draft unless ...

<br /> 

#### General
􏰄 Does each paragraph focus on a single idea or point which is introduced/summarized in the paragraph’s first sentence? A paragraph is like a mini-essay.
􏰄 Is the flow of logic clear from paragraph to paragraph? From your draft, you should be able to (re)write the outline of the paper – in fact, just from the first sentences of the paragraphs. Check this.
􏰄 Did you repeat key points in several sections to emphasize them?
􏰄 Did you spend a lot more time on logic and clarity in addition to grammar and sentence structure? 
􏰄 Have you ruthlessly avoided complicated sentences?

<br />
 
#### Abstract
􏰄 Does the abstract avoid distracting technical details?
􏰄 Is it clear from the abstract why the work is new and worthy of publication?

<br />
 
#### Introduction
􏰄 Did you clearly explain the reason why the work was done – the existing problem?
􏰄 Did you clearly and briefly explain what you did to make progress – what’s new?
􏰄 Did you cite pertinent work done before? Even by people you may not like?
􏰄 Did you read the introductions of several related papers to be sure you explained the ideas properly and cited the important work?

<br />
 
#### Methods
􏰄 Did you remind your readers why a new/old method was used? You can write a mini-introduction for the Methods section.
􏰄 Did you provide enough information so a reader could exactly reproduce your results? The whole procedure should be outlined, even if some details must be found in other work or Supplemental Information.

<br />
 
#### Results
􏰄 Did you make sure the main results are not buried? Again, use mini-introductions.
􏰄 Did you save commentary and speculation for the Discussion section?

<br />
 
#### Discussion
􏰄 Did you clearly explain what’s new, as compared to previous work?
􏰄 DidyouavoidrepeatinginformationfromtheResultssection?
􏰄 Did you admit the limitations of your work?
􏰄 Did you describe future applications, improvements, and generalizations?

<br />
 
#### Conclusions
􏰄 Could a reader in a rush read just the Conclusions and learn just about everything (including acronyms)?
􏰄 Did you avoid exaggeration and let the data speak for itself?
􏰄 Did you acknowledge everyone who helped, including funding agencies?

<br />
 
#### Figures
􏰄 Do figure titles describe the main point of each figure?
􏰄 Have you put labels/arrows in the graphic to minimize effort for the reader?
 
<br />

#### Wait!
􏰄 Did you go back to the ‘General’ section above and double-check those paragraphs and logic – even in the Results section? 
􏰄 Did you make several revisions of the entire manuscript (after completing a first draft)?
􏰄 Did you check journal-specific formatting – section order; figures; references?

Here we collect advice, tips and wisdom to help you get your scientific papers written and published. A successful postdoc should aim for at least two or three high quality papers to be published each year. By high quality we mean good science in [good journals]( {{ "/news/2016/09/18/suggested-readings/" | prepend: site.baseurl }} ). Every results chapter of a graduate students thesis should ideally be a published paper (typically ~4 papers). 


The key to becoming a good efficient writer is to read extensively, practice writing frequently, and get feedback on your writing from others. 


As a graduate student or postdoc you should always be writing something (e.g. drafting your manuscript, writing a review of some interesting and relevant research by others). By this I mean for you to get into the practice of writing and to get feedback on your writing from others.

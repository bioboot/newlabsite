# Example new jekyll based Grant Lab website 

This directory/repo contains the code for the new lab website that will eventually live here: [thegrantlab.org](http://thegrantlab.org/). For now it is available only in preview form on  [GitHub](http://bioboot.github.io/newlabsite/).


## Running locally

You can preview your contributions before opening a pull request by running from within the directory:

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec rake site:preview`

See other jekyll site instructions such as those here: <https://github.com/bioboot/bioinf525_w16/blob/gh-pages/README.md> 
It's just a jekyll site, afterall! :wink:
